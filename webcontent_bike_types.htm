Most motorcycles fall into one of three main categories: street, off-road, and dual-purpose; depending on the surface they are intended to be used on.</p><p><strong>Styles</strong></p><div><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Due to the image and perception the club desires, and the types of rides the club will encounter, the following types of bikes will not be allowed, based on the definitions below: sport, crotch rockets, bullet bikes, dual sport, and off-road.</p><p><strong>Size</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>500cc or equivalent. "A typical 500cc street bike probably has a top speed of around 100 mph, and can cruise for extended periods of time above the legal speed limit on the highway." A 500cc motor will be the smallest size bike allowed due to the type of riding and for the safety of all involved. The club does not want to impede the flow of traffic or leave anyone behind.</p><p><em>* Exceptions may be made on a case by case bases as approved by the Grand Commandery</em><br /> <em> ** All bikes are welcome at club sponsored rallies and events</em><br /> <em> *** Trikes (3-wheeled motorcycles) ARE allowed; however Can-AM Spider types of Trikes are NOT allowed.</em></p><p><strong>Motorcycle Style Definitions</strong></p><p><a href="http://templarknightsmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tkmcMotorcycleTypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-372" title="tkmcMotorcycleTypes" src="http://templarknightsmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tkmcMotorcycleTypes.jpg" alt="" width="754" height="827" /></a></p></div>
