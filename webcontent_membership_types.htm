<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; font-size: small;">A Templar's Requiem</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Morning breaks across Lyon hillside
New suns warmth brings tear to eye,
I lay upon this battle torn field
Among fallen brother I wait to die.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Soaring high above the once serene landscape
Shrill cry of Buzzard and Crow,
A morbid song of what future lies
I fight what my heart doth know.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My mantle lay soiled and tattered
Broken body entrenched in mud,
Sword's hilt still clinched within cold numb fingers
upon breast, red cross stained with blood.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A line was drawn and held by sword
"Beauseant!" cried strong against Melee,
Deterred the Pope's Force from what marvels they sought
A Holy Relic from Un-pure could flee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Swinging high the blade of greed and sin
Treacherous threat once trusted and revered,
Struck fatal blow to the Knight's of God
A deception void of honor coldly served.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">With honor, faith and a fiery wrath
Blood oath was spilt yet held secure,
A promise to god despite mortal threat and loss,
upon heavenly Alter their Soul's shall rest pure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">With warmth and light of a new born day
Last breath whispers from wounded chest,
Eyes now sightless to a beautiful blue sky
head laid back in God's hands to rest.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; font-size: small;">The cry the Templar's raised upon entering battle. When voiced by large numbers entering battle the sound unnerved the enemy and was ominous due to its vibrant sound. Translation- Be Glorious!</span></div>
