Templar Knights are true to their creed and just to their country, and not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, yielding obedience to the laws which afford you protection. Let not interest, favor or prejudice bias your integrity or influence you to be guilty of a dishonorable action, but let your conduct be uniform and your deportment suitable to the dignity of your fraternal order.

Above all, practice fortitude, prudence, temperance, and honor. For these virtues have distinguished Templar Knights in every age and nation.

This creed is my marrow. Am I not also garbed in the creed, for it tells me what I wear. The Creed is within me and about me. It is my hand when I fight and tells me what my weapons are. Within and Without.

A Templar Knight is truly a fearless knight, and secure on every side, for his soul is protected by the armour of faith, just as his body is protected by the armour of steel. He is thus doubly-armed, and need fear neither demons nor men.
